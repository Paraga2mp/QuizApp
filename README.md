# QuizApp

This is a two screen Android application in portrait mode that allows a user to
prepare for ‘matching-style’ quizzes. When the program is running, it displays one
term and four possible definitions; one of which is the correct one. The user will
then select which definition they think matches the term displayed. The program
will indicate if the user has made a correct or incorrect selection by displaying a
toast message to that affect.

The first page of the application presents the user with a means of entering their
name. The application uses an intent to navigate to the next page and pass this
information from the first page of the application to the second page for display
purposes. The second page is where the testing itself takes place. The users score
maintained and displayed on this page or via an intent on a third page once the
testing is complete.
